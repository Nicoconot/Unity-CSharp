# Public Unity C# Projects
Hey there! Thanks for coming by. My name is Nico, I'm a game developer mostly focused on Unity and C#. Here I share  some of the code I've created and want to share, not necessarily associated with their full projects(sorry, copyright!). What's in here I've designed and made from scratch, and everything is extensively commented. Please feel free to use whatever you find here, if you need it. I also take requests!

##Project Descriptions

###Project Pigment
This is an ongoing puzzle platformer game being developed for a client. It's got a shooting system, basic enemy AI and several ways to interact with the environment. It's mostly about problem-solving rather than skill. 
The initial target audience is childrens and teens aged 7-14 yeard old.
The name is not final.

###Trauma Elevator
This is a passion project being slowly developed after we(Lightkeeper's Machine) created its prototype for Ludum Dare 48. It's a twin-stick shooter that takes place entirely inside an elevator, with monsters swarming you in between each floor. Much like games such as Hades or Moonlighter, after you die you can customize your experience, buy power-ups and upgrade your elevator. The idea is that the game takes place inside your mind, as your fight your inner demons in a psychiatric facility.
